# Graphenemolecularsim
This project uses a Molecular Dynamics Simulation strategy to create a viable model of the molecular structure of Graphene, a two-dimensional carbon allotrope. Using its unique chemical and physical properties, we will test to confirm its potential in many everyday applications, including, but not limited to, transistors, semiconductors, telecommunication cables, and touchscreens. Graphene will most likely be the computing material of the future, an enormous change from the Silicon that is used currently. As such, it is vital to test the different components of Graphite to model its true potential in the future.
